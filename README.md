### About me

Hi there!

I'm just a random C#, C++ hobbyst programmer just doing his own dream projects. I'm mainly interested in game development, graphics programming, and reverse engineering.

## Projects

| | Description | Languages | Repository |
|--|--|--|--|
| **3DRadSpace** | A spiritual successor to a game engine named 3D Rad. The goal of the engine is rapid development while being lightweight. | C++, C#, HLSL, CMake | [Link](https://github.com/3DRadSpace/3D_Rad_Space) |
| Stride (contributor)|A game engine written almost entirely in C#, with focus on realistic rendering and VR. I contributed by fixing a bug in the FBX animation importer. |C++, C#| [Link](https://github.com/stride3d/stride) |
