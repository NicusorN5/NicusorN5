### About me

Hi there!

I'm just a hobbyst programmer with interests in 3D graphics, reverse engineering and software preservation.

## Projects
Projects that I'm working on.

| | Description | Languages | Repository |
|--|--|--|--|
| **3DRadSpace** | A spiritual successor to a game engine named 3D Rad. The goal of the engine is rapid development while being lightweight. | C++ 23, C#, HLSL, CMake | [Link](https://github.com/3DRadSpace/3D_Rad_Space) |
| Mario Worker Ultimate | A remake of "Mario Worker" with LUA scripting and custom entities | C++ 20, LUA | [Link](https://github.com/NicusorN5/Mario-Worker-Ultimate) |
