### About me

Hi there!

I'm just a random C# and C++ hobbyst programmer just doing his own dream projects. Maybe you're here for my game engine, or maybe for some library I made a while ago. Or maybe for some VC:MP scripts that keep crashing every 20 minutes.

I want to let you know, dear reader, that I wish you a great day!

### Main projects
