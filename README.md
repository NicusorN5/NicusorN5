### About me

Hi there!

I'm just a random C#, C++ and Rust hobbyst programmer just doing his own dream projects. I'm mainly interested in game development, graphics programming, and reverse engineering.

### Main projects

>A spiritual successor to a game engine named 3D Rad. The goal of the engine is being as lightweight and performant as possible, and also easy to use, just like Fernando Zanini's original 3D Rad.
